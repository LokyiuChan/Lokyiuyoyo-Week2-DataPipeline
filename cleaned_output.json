      "title": "Trump’s Lawsuit Against I.R.S. Creates ‘Enormous Conflict of Interest’",
      "content": "Federal law fiercely protects the confidentiality of Americans’ tax returns. Not only can improper disclosure of tax information carry criminal penalties, but people can also sue the government if the Internal Revenue Service mishandles their data.Not until Thursday, though, had a sitting president filed such a suit. President Trump’s complaint, filed in federal court in Miami against the I.R.S. and the Treasury Department, created what legal experts said was the unparalleled situation of federal agencies facing a lawsuit from the head of the executive branch. Mr. Trump has demanded at least $10 billion in damages.“It’s an enormous conflict of interest,” said Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. “His own appointees could turn around and say: ‘Let’s give the Trump family a couple of billion. That’s a fair sell.’”Mr. Trump’s suit accuses the I.R.S. and the Treasury of not doing enough to prevent the leak of his tax returns by Charles Littlejohn, a former I.R.S. contractor who has admitted to giving Mr. Trump’s tax returns to The New York Times. Mr. Littlejohn was sentenced to five years in prison for leaking Mr. Trump’s returns, as well as tax information about ultrawealthy Americans that Mr. Littlejohn separately provided to ProPublica.Mr. Trump, who brought the suit along with two of his sons and his family business, is not without merit, legal experts said. But its success would hinge on genuine legal questions that the Justice Department, which would represent the I.R.S., may or may not contest in court.“It’s not a crazy lawsuit,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at Cardozo Law School. “It should be taken seriously and if it was anyone other than the president bringing the lawsuit you would say, ‘I can understand this.’”The Treasury and the I.R.S. did not respond to requests for comment about how they would respond to the suit. The Justice Department and the White House declined to comment.Trump Administration: Live UpdatesUpdated Feb. 1, 2026, 7:17 p.m. ETTrump says the Kennedy Center will close for a 2-year reconstruction project.A U.A.E. firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family’s crypto company.Liam, the 5-year-old detained while wearing a bunny hat, is out of federal custody.The first question is whether the I.R.S. could be held liable for the conduct of Mr. Littlejohn, a contractor who worked for Booz Allen and not the I.R.S. The billionaire Ken Griffin previously sued the I.R.S. over Mr. Littlejohn’s leak of his tax returns to ProPublica, and in that case the agency argued that it was not responsible for Mr. Littlejohn’s actions. Mr. Griffin and the I.R.S. settled the case, and the agency apologized for the leak.Another question is whether Mr. Trump has brought his lawsuit quickly enough. Under federal law, people have two years to sue the government after they discover that their tax returns have been improperly disclosed. While Mr. Littlejohn pleaded guilty in October 2023, Mr. Trump’s complaint said that he did not know that his tax return information had been leaked from the I.R.S. until he received a notice about it from the agency on Jan. 29, 2024 — exactly two years before he filed the suit.“There was quite a bit of litigation and press coverage concerning the nature of the disclosure that Littlejohn engaged in,” said Leslie Book, a law professor at Villanova. “To argue, as Trump is arguing in the suit, that he wasn’t aware of this, that he didn’t discover it until the I.R.S. sent that letter, frankly, I find hard to support.”Given those issues, Francesca Ugolini, a former lawyer at the Justice Department’s tax division, said that, in a vacuum, she would expect the government would try to have Mr. Trump’s lawsuit dismissed. But she is not sure that the Justice Department would want to vigorously contest the president’s claims, and Mr. Trump’s appointees may seek to settle the case.“It’s hard to imagine that they wouldn’t feel that pressure, even if it wasn’t explicit,” she said. Congress could try to limit the Justice Department’s ability to pay a settlement to Mr. Trump, she said, but otherwise “there’s not really another check.”Mr. Trump has previously sought to extract payments from the Justice Department, demanding that the department pay him about $230 million in compensation for the federal investigations into him. The department has also been responsive to Mr. Trump’s call for the government to prosecute people he perceives as his political enemies.How the I.R.S. protects taxpayer information is closely scrutinized. Republicans pointed to the leak of Mr. Trump’s and other wealthy Americans’ tax information as evidence that the agency was biased against conservatives. Hunter Biden accused the I.R.S. of improperly releasing his tax information, suing the agency while his father was president. Mr. Biden later dropped the case.The Trump administration has sought to use protected taxpayer records at the I.R.S. to help with immigration enforcement. The I.R.S. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached a deal last year to share taxpayer information, though a judge later blocked the agencies from doing so.",

      "title": "The Trump Administration Has Been Sued 600 Times. Track These Cases.",
      "content": "By Emma Schartz, Camille Baker, Seamus Hughes, Bernard Mokam, Jasmine C. Lee, Lazaro Gamio, Alex Lemonides, Sarah Cahalan and Mattathias Schwartz The Trump administration’s sweeping policy changes face a number of lawsuits — more than 600. In more than 350 cases, the courts have let the administration’s policies stay in effect even as they remain in active litigation. In more than 150 cases, however, the courts have at least partially halted the administration’s policies either through temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions. Here is a snapshot of where the lawsuits against President Trump stand, highlighting district court cases where a judge has entered a final order for or against the administration. Many of those cases have been appealed. Cases with at least one active appeal The Supreme Court has also taken action in 28 cases. Four cases are pending action by the court. Tap a card to read more This case is expected to be the decisive legal battle over the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime law used by Mr. Trump to deport immigrants he has accused of belonging to a violent Venezuelan street gang. A block on Mr. Trump’s attempt to deploy the National Guard in Illinois over the objections of state and local officials remains in place after the Supreme Court rejected the administration’s arguments that the deployment was legal. Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender women with male inmates and stop medical treatment related to gender transitions. After the Trump administration sought to enact a sweeping freeze on federal funding to states, more than 20 sued the Office of Management and Budget, saying the freeze was unlawful. The Supreme Court is now considering the legality of Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors because of the administration’s claim that she engaged in mortgage fraud, despite never having been charged or convicted of a crime. This class-action lawsuit will most likely yield a decisive ruling from the Supreme Court on whether Mr. Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship for the babies of undocumented immigrants violates the 14th Amendment’s grant of citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” A majority of Supreme Court justices sounded skeptical during November oral arguments over the legality of tariffs that Mr. Trump has sought to impose on more than 100 countries using a 1977 emergency law. Perkins Coie was among a small number of law firms that refused to strike a deal to do free legal work for the Trump administration’s favored causes. The lawsuits fall into these categories. The White House has used its power over access to federal property to single out certain organizations for punishment, prompting legal action. For instance, the Trump administration barred The Associated Press from certain press events because it uses the name Gulf of Mexico in its articles, rather than “Gulf of America.” In February 2025, the Trump administration barred The Associated Press from certain events for its use of the term “Gulf of Mexico.” A federal judge said the administration’s move amounted to a violation of the First Amendment. An appeals court later ruled that the president could, for now, block the news outlet from small places such as the Oval Office or Air Force One. Read more › Perkins Coie was among a small number of law firms that refused to strike a deal to do free legal work for the Trump administration’s favored causes. Instead, it chose to face an executive order that seeks to strip lawyers of their security clearances and bar them from working for the federal government. District court judges have ruled against the legality of Mr. Trump’s order, and the administration has filed an appeal with the D.C. Circuit. Read more › In March, Mr. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, in an effort to round up and deport scores of immigrants who he claimed were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Federal courts around the country have been divided on whether he has properly used the law. This case is expected to be the decisive legal battle over the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime law used by Mr. Trump to deport immigrants he has accused of belonging to a violent Venezuelan street gang. The Supreme Court has already made a preliminary ruling that the immigrants did not receive sufficient notice of their deportations, but has not ruled on the overall legality of Mr. Trump’s proclamation. A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has rejected the administration’s claim that Venezuelans in the U.S. amounted to an “invasion,” and the case will now be considered by the full court in an “en banc” rehearing. On his first day back in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to stop treating as U.S. citizens any children born in the United States after a certain date whose parents are undocumented or who are in the country legally but temporarily. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the adminstration’s directive, but it did decide in June that several district court judges had exceeded their authority in blocking the policy across the country. A new lawsuit filed by the A.C.L.U. is now challenging the policy. With an executive order, Mr. Trump tried to reframe the long-settled historical understanding of birthright citizenship to exclude babies born to undocumented immigrants. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the order’s constitutionality, but it did limit the authority of lower-court judges to block executive branch policies nationwide. The district-court judge then certified this case as a class-action suit and again blocked the new policy. The case is now on hold as it awaits a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of Mr. Trump’s order from another case, Barbara v. Trump. Read more › This class-action lawsuit will most likely yield a decisive ruling from the Supreme Court on whether Mr. Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship for the babies of undocumented immigrants violates the 14th Amendment’s grant of citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” In a preliminary ruling, a district-court judge found that Mr. Trump’s executive order was most likely unconstitutional, rejecting the administration’s argument that U.S. citizenship flows from a person’s “lawful domicile” as opposed to their birthplace. Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump said he was revoking several Biden-era environmental policies, including protections against drilling in certain areas along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and in the Arctic. On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum that would halt all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms pending a government review, and would direct federal agencies to stop issuing permits for all wind farms. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia sued, saying the order was outside the president’s authority and contrary to existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. In December 2025, a district judge ruled that the wind order was contrary to the law. Read more › In the first few months of Mr. Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency moved to enact a series of sweeping cuts across the government including eliminating government agencies like the U.S. Institute of Peace and firing broad swaths of federal workers. The Trump administration took over and gutted the U.S. Institute of Peace, an independent nonprofit created by Congress to seek diplomatic solutions to global conflicts. The administration’s action resulted in a series of events that included a dramatic confrontation among agency staff, DOGE representatives, private security and law enforcement authorities. A federal judge ordered the reinstatement of officials ejected by the White House, but an appeals court stayed the order, yielding control of the institute back to Mr. Trump while the case proceeded. Read more › In his second term, Mr. Trump has tried to fire a number of government officials, including agency watchdogs and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Several federal judges have said that Mr. Trump did not have the power to fire the officials in question. The Supreme Court has sided with the president in some cases, but has not yet ruled on a lawsuit brought by Lisa Cook, who has continued to sit on the Fed’s Board of Governors. In May, President Trump fired three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a five-member group that monitors the safety of products like toys, cribs and electronics. A federal law allows them to be terminated for only “neglect of duty or malfeasance,” but the president gave no reasons for the firings. A federal judge initially reinstated the commission members, but in July 2025 the Supreme Court released an order allowing Mr. Trump to enforce the firing. An appeals court put the case on hold in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling on Slaughter v. Trump. Read more › In March 2025, Mr. Trump fired Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a Federal Trade commissioner, and her colleague Alvaro Bedoya as he asserted control over agencies that regulate companies and workplaces. The move challenged longstanding legal precedent that members of the F.T.C. could be fired for only a narrow set of reasons. A federal court ruled that Mr. Trump’s firing of Slaughter was illegal. Bedoya’s claim was dismissed in July after he resigned from the commission in June. That September, the Supreme Court stayed the lower court's ruling, removing Slaughter from her role temporarily until the case could be argued in front of the Supreme Court before the end of 2025. Read more › The Supreme Court is now considering the legality of Mr. Trump’s attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors because of the administration’s claim that she engaged in mortgage fraud, despite never having been charged or convicted of a crime. Both a district court judge and an appellate panel have issued temporary rulings that block the firing, and Ms. Cook remains active in her role at the Fed, for now. Read more › President Trump moved to fire Hampton Dellinger, the head of the Office of Special Counsel. Dellinger sued, saying his removal was unlawful. In a subsequent appeal, judges sided with the Trump administration, effectively removing Dellinger from his position. He later dropped his case. Mr. Trump has moved to freeze or terminate billions of dollars in federal funding for scientific research, mental health services, art programs, educational programs, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, school lunches, disaster preparedness, foreign assistance and transportation infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security issued new rules requiring states and cities that receive grants for disaster preparation and recovery to adhere to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or face the possibility of losing billions of dollars. A coalition of 20 state attorneys general sued the department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying the requirements were illegal and would cause irreparable harm. In September 2025, a district judge ruled in favor of the state attorneys, ordering the distribution of disaster relief funds despite individual state immigration policies. After the Trump administration sought to enact a sweeping freeze on federal funding to states, more than 20 sued the Office of Management and Budget, saying the freeze was unlawful. A judge later found that the White House had failed to comply with a temporary order to unfreeze the funds. Read more › The Department of Transportation announced that it would require states that receive its grants to adhere to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Twenty states sued, saying that the administration’s requirements were unconstitutional and that “more people will die” if billions in federal transportation funding were withheld. In June 2025, a federal judge blocked the administration’s move, concluding that the requirement was unconstitutional. A number of lawsuits challenge the administration’s immigration policies, including its efforts to authorize immigration agents to enter houses of worship, speed up and broaden the scope of deportations, withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities and make it harder for refugees to claim asylum in the United States. One of the most closely watched cases concerns a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who in March was deported to a prison in El Salvador without a hearing. The Trump administration has accused Mr. Abrego Garcia of having ties to the MS-13 gang. On May 30, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration, for now, to revoke a Biden-era humanitarian program intended to give temporary residency to more than 500,000 immigrants from countries facing war and political turmoil. The ruling exposes some migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to possible deportation. Earlier in the month, the justices allowed the administration, for now, to remove deportation protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants who had been allowed to remain in the United States under a program known as Temporary Protected Status. The administration detained Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the immigrant who was wrongfully expelled to El Salvador, for a second time in August 2025. The administration has indicated that it plans to re-deport him to Uganda. Read more › In March, a Turkish graduate student who co-wrote an essay criticizing Israel in a student newspaper was arrested outside her Massachusetts home by masked federal agents. The student, Rumeysa Ozturk, sued, saying the government had detained her in unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech. After Ms. Ozturk spent six weeks in detention, a judge ordered her to be released while her case continues. The administration has been fighting in court to again detain and then deport Mahmoud Khalil — a legal permanent resident, Columbia University graduate, and prominent figure in the pro-Palestinian movement — after jailing him for months last year. The administration has claimed that Mr. Khalil’s presence in the U.S. contributed to the spread of antisemitism, and later claimed he omitted key facts from his permanent residency application. Mr. Khalil’s lawyers have denied the allegations of antisemitism and protested his detention as unconstitutional retaliation for free speech. He was released on bail in June 2025. In January, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit opened the possibility that he could be rearrested, but he remains free while that ruling is appealed. Read more › In May 2025, the Trump administration said it would halt Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students, taking aim at a crucial funding source for the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college. The move was a major escalation of the administration’s efforts to pressure the school to fall in line with the president’s agenda. Less than 24 hours later, the university sued the administration, accusing it of a “campaign of retribution.” That June, a federal judge in Boston sided with Harvard and blocked a Trump administration effort to rescind the school’s right to host international students. The administration has appealed the decision. Read more › State officials, small businesses and political groups have sued the Trump administration over its tariff policy, contending that the president does not have the authority to impose tariffs on foreign goods without congressional approval. A majority of Supreme Court justices sounded skeptical during November oral arguments over the legality of tariffs that Mr. Trump has sought to impose on more than 100 countries using a 1977 emergency law. The administration’s tariff capability remains in place for now. If the justices agree with the lower courts and strike it down, that would release billions of dollars in refunds as well as the likelihood of further litigation, should the administration use a new statute, or statutes, to claim unilateral tariff powers. Read more › Several lawsuits challenge the Trump administration’s moves to prohibit recognizing transgender people according to their gender identity. Cases have included placing transgender women who are federal prisoners in men’s housing and witholding federal funding from hospitals that offer gender-related treatment to patients younger than 19. Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the Bureau of Prisons to house transgender women with male inmates and stop medical treatment related to gender transitions. Three transgender women in prison sued, saying they had a right to essential medical care and to be kept safe while incarcerated. A judge temporarily blocked the order, and the Trump administration has appealed the case. Read more › With their parents and advocacy groups, six transgender people between the ages of 12 and 18 sued to block Mr. Trump’s executive order that sought to restrict medical treatments for trans youths, arguing that it violated the Constitution. A judge temporarily ordered the administration to continue federal funding for hospitals that offer transition care for people under the age of 19, a decision the Trump administration has appealed. Read more › Dozens of other suits have been filed against the Trump administration. They are about issues like the government’s attempt to block New York City’s congestion pricing program, a law that would have prevented some Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving Medicaid reimbursements and the removal of books about race and gender from Department of Defense schools. A block on Mr. Trump’s attempt to deploy the National Guard in Illinois over the objections of state and local officials remains in place after the Supreme Court rejected the administration’s arguments that the deployment was legal. The Supreme Court’s ruling was on the emergency docket, so the issue could be considered again on the court’s merits docket. Mr. Trump has said he might invoke the Insurrection Act, which would potentially offer a separate legal basis for Guard deployments, and touch off more lawsuits. After the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops in Los Angeles to respond to protests, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had illegally taken control of the state’s troops. He ordered them to return to taking orders from Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. An appeals court subsequently stayed that decision, which means the National Guard forces will stay subject to Mr. Trump’s control for now. Read more › About the data The New York Times is tracking cases filed against Mr. Trump or his administration since the start of his second term on Jan. 20, 2025. The page is updated on weekdays. If a case has an active preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order (meaning a policy has been halted), an appeal or judgment, it is noted in the case description. Cases under the “Alien Enemies Act” section challenge the administration’s use of the act in deportation efforts. Cases challenging the threat to cancel student visas are not included except in suits that have received national-level media attention. Consolidated cases are labeled on the primary, active case, and only the primary case is shown. However, each case is included in the total number of lawsuits facing the Trump administration. One exception to this is cases where individual businesses are challenging the administration’s tariffs. These are counted as a single group rather than as individual filings.

      "title": "Rubio Says Venezuela Will Submit Monthly Budget to White House",
      "content": "Venezuela’s interim government has agreed to submit a monthly “budget” to the Trump administration, which will release money from an account funded by the country’s oil sales and initially managed by Qatar, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.But the plan drew sharp questions from skeptical Democrats, and Mr. Rubio conceded that it was “novel” and hastily designed. The role of Qatar — a Middle Eastern country thousands of miles from Venezuela whose ruler has won President Trump’s favor — drew particular criticism from Democrats, who questioned its legality and transparency.Mr. Rubio detailed the plan during an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It was Mr. Rubio’s first public testimony to Congress since American forces captured Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3, and an opportunity to clarify U.S. policy toward the country.Many questions are sure to persist, however.Mr. Rubio assured senators, for instance, that the Trump administration had established a “very respectful and productive line of communication” with the government of Delcy Rodríguez, a close ally of Mr. Maduro who assumed power after his removal. As a result, he said, the Trump administration does not “intend or expect” to use military force against Venezuela “at any time.”Yet Mr. Rubio took a more threatening tone in a written opening statement that he submitted to the committee but did not deliver orally, making brief extemporaneous remarks instead. The written statement warned that the United States was “prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation” from Ms. Rodríguez’s government “if other methods fail.”That cooperation is largely focused on Venezuela’s lucrative oil industry. Mr. Trump has previously said that the United States will control Venezuela’s oil and “run the country,” but Mr. Rubio provided more details.The United States will help Venezuela’s government fund basic public services by disbursing proceeds from the sale of Venezuelan oil that is subject to U.S. sanctions, Mr. Rubio said. He said that the approach was necessary because of a “fiscal crunch” in Venezuela and that it was a “short-term mechanism” not meant to become permanent.“They needed money in the immediacy to fund the police officers, the sanitation workers, the daily operations of government,” Mr. Rubio added. “They have pledged to use a substantial amount of those funds to purchase medicine and equipment directly from the United States.”In an arrangement that he acknowledged was unusual, Mr. Rubio said the funds would initially be held in an offshore account controlled by Qatar before eventual transferral to a U.S. Treasury account.ImageA billboard of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas, Venezuela, last week.Credit...The New York Times“I understand it’s novel, but it’s the best we could come up with in the short term,” Mr. Rubio said.He said a third-party account was necessary because of U.S. financial sanctions on Venezuela and because U.S. creditors to whom the country owes money, mainly from its seizure of American energy company assets roughly 20 years ago, could otherwise make legal claims on the funds that would complicate their disbursement.The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the plan.Some Democrats had doubts. “I think this is novel. I think it’s funky. I think it may not even be permissible,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, told Mr. Rubio.Mr. Schatz questioned whether the Trump administration had the legal authority to create and manage such an account. He also complained that the administration had not released the text of what Mr. Rubio said was a written agreement with Ms. Rodríguez’s government.Mr. Rubio said the Treasury Department could provide the agreement.Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said in a statement that Mr. Rubio’s testimony “raised more questions than answers,” and demanded to know why, instead of Qatar, the administration had not chosen “a country with much stronger banking laws and a history of robust management of oil revenues.”“There are currently no safeguards to ensure the Rodríguez family does not use the revenue to pay off Maduro’s allies, including paramilitary groups and drug cartels, to maintain control of the country,” Mr. Doggett said.And by shielding the money from creditors through the use of the Qatari account, he added, the Trump administration is “unlawfully refusing to honor debts owed to U.S. institutions.”Mr. Rubio also parried questions about whether and when the United States would insist on a political transition that removed Mr. Maduro’s cronies from their continued hold on power.“I can’t give you a timeline of how long it takes,” he said. “It can’t take forever. I get it. We all want something immediately. But this is not a frozen dinner you put in a microwave and in two and a half minutes it comes out ready to eat.”Mr. Rubio’s undelivered written remarks suggested that Ms. Rodríguez had bought herself some time. “It is our belief that her own self-interest aligns with advancing our key objectives,” he wrote. “She has committed to opening Venezuela’s energy sector to American companies, providing preferential access to production, and using revenues to purchase American goods.”While many Republicans praised Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump for what they called decisive action against Mr. Maduro, that policy did not sit well with many Democrats.“You are taking their oil at gunpoint,” Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut said. “You’re deciding how and for what purposes that money is going to be used in a country of 30 million people,” he added. “I think a lot of us believe that that is destined for failure.”",

      "title": "Here’s the Latest Trump Tariffs on Countries and Products",
      "content": "New rate Upcoming deadline Deal rate Baseline By Tony Romm, Lazaro Gamio and Agnes Chang Since returning to office, President Trump has waged a global trade war without parallel in modern history. Nearly every country has seen duties rise considerably on its goods imported into the United States, while a vast range of foreign-made products — including steel and cars — are also now subject to higher levies. The actions amount to an audacious gamble by the White House, which believes its policies can reset the world trading order, raise new federal revenue and pressure private businesses to make more of their products domestically. Whether Mr. Trump can succeed in his sweeping campaign remains an open question with great consequence for the U.S. economy. His threats, most recently levied against Europe and South Korea, have at times rattled financial markets and risked price increases for American businesses and consumers, who often foot the bill for higher duties on imported goods. The moves come as the Supreme Court continues to grapple with the legality of the president’s many tariffs. A decision is expected soon, and if Mr. Trump were to lose the case, it could potentially invalidate many of his punishing duties around the world. Rates reach as high as 50 percent. At the end of July, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on roughly 90 countries that he accused of treating the United States unfairly on trade. He implemented the bulk of his new duties on Aug. 7, capping off months of haggling, tinkering and delay, which began after the president’s proclamation of “Liberation Day” in the spring. To implement the duties, a power generally reserved for Congress, Mr. Trump invoked a 1970s economic emergency law that does not explicitly mention the word tariff. No president before him had ever interpreted the statute in this way, touching off a landmark Supreme Court battle. During oral arguments, justices expressed skepticism that Mr. Trump had the authority to wield tariffs in such a sprawling way. Many economists had warned that these tariffs, and others around the world, could result in price increases for Americans. Perhaps in an indirect acknowledgment of that, Mr. Trump announced in November that he would lift tariffs on bread, beef, tomatoes, bananas, coffee and orange juice. But Mr. Trump has left many tariffs in place, including sky-high rates targeting goods from Brazil and India. Mr. Trump imposed some of the tariffs on Brazil because of its treatment of his political ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. And the president imposed higher tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. Some of the highest new tariffs were reserved for the world’s second-largest economy. “Fentanyl”tariff ”Reciprocal“tariff Rate rise as China responds Highest level Negotiated truce rate Reduced “fentanyl” tariff After a meeting last year between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, the United States announced that it would reduce fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods to 10 percent from 20 percent. The reduction brought the total new tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on goods from China to 20 percent. Other tariffs may also apply to Chinese goods, depending on the nature of the product. Before the trade truce, the two sides seemed to be barrelling toward another tit-for-tat escalation, as Mr. Trump threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on all Chinese imports beginning in November, “over and above” existing duties. The president escalated his trade war over concerns that China had unfairly restricted the export of rare earths, which are critical to the manufacture of many high-tech products including motors and computer chips. In an earlier battle between Washington and Beijing over export restrictions, trade between the United States and China essentially came to a halt, rattling financial markets and raising fears of price increases for U.S. consumers. China has long been a target for Mr. Trump, dating back to his first term. Upon returning to office, he initially sought to penalize Beijing for failing to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States. But he has since wielded tariffs to address a broad range of grievances. Two of America’s closest trading partners face steep tariffs, though many goods have been exempted. Canada now faces a tariff of 35 percent, up from 25 percent, under an order that Mr. Trump signed last year. Mexico, meanwhile, received a temporary reprieve in 2025. Its exports were slated to be subject to a 25 percent tariff on Oct. 31, though President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico said on Oct. 27 that the United States had given her country more time to make trade policy changes to avoid the increase. White House officials have exempted some goods from both countries that were already covered by a trade deal brokered by the three countries during the president’s first term: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A. Mr. Trump first took aim at Canada and Mexico in February 2025, announcing a 25 percent import tax on all arriving goods, which the president justified by saying the two nations had not sufficiently helped to combat the flow of fentanyl. Facing blowback domestically and abroad, he later paused and modified that arrangement to reflect the U.S.M.C.A. while talks continued. The White House has struck agreements with major trading partners, including the European Union. Mr. Trump initially sought to broker 90 deals in 90 days, as one of his advisers described it. While the White House ultimately fell far short of that goal, the president did manage to strike a series of preliminary trade agreements with some of its key trading partners, including Taiwan, South Korea and countries in the European Union. As a general rule, each of the deals announced over the past year has set imports from those countries’ tariffs at 15 percent or higher. The agreements lowered what would have been steeper duties in exchange for favorable trade concessions and new promises to invest in the United States. But much remains uncertain about how those arrangements will be implemented in the years to come. Nor have the truces stopped Mr. Trump from issuing additional trade threats. In January, for example, he promised to impose massive tariffs on European countries for refusing to accept his demands to take over Greenland, though he later backed down. Then, later in the month, Mr. Trump said he would raise the levies on South Korean goods, claiming that the nation’s leaders had not “enacted our Historic Trade Agreement” swiftly enough. Tariffs target products deemed by Mr. Trump to be essential to national security. The president's tariffs generally fall into two categories: Taxes imposed on imports arriving from certain countries, and duties that apply to specific products often without regard to their origin. In recent months, Mr. Trump has focused his energy on the latter variety, using a provision of federal law — Section 232 — meant to address trade issues that present national security threats. The president has announced duties on imported steel; aluminum; cars; car parts; heavy-duty trucks; lumber and wood products, including bathroom and kitchen cabinets and upholstered furniture. (He later suspended some of the planned increases on those lumber products.) He also imposed a 25 percent tariff on a limited set of semiconductors, under a unique setup that is meant to ensure the U.S. government receives a cut of chip sales to China. The president has signaled on numerous occasions that he is pursuing additional industry-specific tariffs. Mr. Trump can issue these tariffs after the government conducts a national security investigation, which it has initiated for wind turbines, another industry that the president has sought to tax. In some cases, these industry-specific tariffs do not pile on top of the duties that Mr. Trump has imposed on specific countries. For others, like the European Union, agreements brokered with the United States would override the sector-specific duties. Even the smallest nations are subject to a baseline tax on their imports. Some countries have not been targeted with specific new tariff threats. Instead, they are subject to a flat, 10 percent tariff on all imports into the United States, under an order Mr. Trump signed last year. The loophole had allowed American shoppers to buy cheap goods without paying tariffs. Even as Mr. Trump imposed his most unforgiving tariffs, his administration largely left in place a policy that allowed Americans to import goods up to $800 without facing duties. The policy, known as the de minimis exemption, officially ended in late August, meaning that these goods will face tariffs based on their country of origin. The president previously eliminated this exemption on goods arriving from China, in a move that threatened to deliver a blow to e-commerce, since 60 percent of de minimis shipments to the United States came from that country and Hong Kong. Here’s where things stand for all countries and trading partners: Notes: The “fentanyl” tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada only apply to goods not covered under the U.S.M.C.A. Brazil has an additional “free speech” tariff, China has an additional “fentanyl” tariff. The president said that imports from India would face an additional penalty for the country’s imports of Russian oil, in addition to the 25 percent Aug. 1 tariff. Some goods from the European Union may be subject to different tariff rates. New rates for E.U. countries are dependent on existing tariff rates on individual goods, and designed to be a minimum of 15 percent.

      "title": "Trump Says Kennedy Center Will Close for 2-Year Reconstruction Project",
      "content": "President Trump announced Sunday that he would shut down the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which has been battered by cancellations and boycotts, for two years starting this summer. He said that would allow his administration to transform what he called “a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center,” into “the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind.”Mr. Trump’s announcement came after a major backlash by performers, contributors and audience members and amounted to a sudden change in direction for what has been a high visibility initiative of his second term.From his first weeks in office, Mr. Trump set out to remake the center, opened as a tribute to John F. Kennedy after his assassination in 1963, in his image. But in the discussions of that remaking, which included talk of renovations, there had been no public discussion of anything as drastic as a full two-year shutdown.In recent months, Mr. Trump had attached his name to the center, installed loyalists to run it, including Richard Grenell, the center’s president, and called for changing the programming there to make it more in line with what he said was widespread American tastes and sensibilities: more “Les Miz” and less “Hamilton,” as he put it on one visit to the center.The reaction has been harsh and unrelenting. Last week, Philip Glass, the acclaimed American composer, said he was withdrawing Symphony No. 15, which had been commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra in tribute to Abraham Lincoln, that was to be performed there in June. A week earlier, the acclaimed soprano Renée Fleming canceled a performance.ImagePhilip Glass, the acclaimed composer, at the Kennedy Center in Washington in 2015. Last week, he said he was withdrawing his work that was to be performed at the center in June.Credit...Gabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesThe Washington National Opera announced last month that it was cutting its ties to the center, and the other classical music anchor there, the National Symphony Orchestra, has been playing to empty seats.But Mr. Trump, in his social media post, made no mention of the cancellations or the patrons who are now staying home: attendance at the National Symphony Orchestra is down 50 percent over last year. Instead, he presented it as his latest effort to rebuild part of Washington — following the demolition of the East Wing of the White House and his proposal to build a towering arch across from the Washington Monument.The Kennedy Center underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2019 under Deborah Rutter, the Kennedy Center president who left shortly after Mr. Trump took office. But Mr. Trump had earlier seemed unhappy with that expansion, which cost $250 million, saying “they built these rooms that nobody is going to use.”The president said that funding had been found for his new project — but did not say how much it would cost or where the money was coming from. Last year, Mr. Trump secured $257 million from Congress to help with capital repairs on the building, and his allies have credited him with having “saved” the center.He offered no details of what kind of reconstruction he had in mind, other than to say it would entail “Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding.” Mr. Trump said the changes would have to be approved by the Kennedy Center board — which he controls — but made no mention of whether it would need approval by Congress as well.The center will shut down on July 4, he said Sunday, coinciding with the nation’s celebration of its 250th birthday. He said that a dramatic step was necessary to safeguard one of Washington’s most treasured cultural institutions.“In other words, if we don’t close, the quality of Construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many Events using the Facility, will be much longer,” he wrote on Truth Social. “The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!”The decision was a dramatic intervention for a performing arts institution that, in recent years, has put on more than 2,000 performances and events annually.The staff at the Kennedy Center has undergone its own transformation over the past year as dozens of employees, many with decades of experience in arts programming, have been fired or quit. On Sunday, some staff members and one Kennedy board member said they had learned the news through the president’s announcement. Shortly after, Mr. Grenell wrote in a staff-wide email that “we recognize this creates many questions as we plan to temporarily close most of our operations.”ImageRichard Grenell, the Kennedy Center president, at the premiere of “Melania” at the venue last week. Credit...Eric Lee for The New York Times“We will have more information about staffing and operational changes in the coming days,” the email said.White House officials declined to address questions about when the president had reached his shutdown decision or whether he intended to seek Congressional approval for the project.Mr. Trump’s takeover of the center has been met with objections from some Democrats in Congress who have challenged his legal right to rename the center.On Sunday, Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee that oversees funding for the Kennedy Center’s building, questioned the motivation for the planned closure in a video posted to social media, suggesting that the president was just “covering up the financial disaster he’s created there.”“This man has destroyed the place,” she said in the video. “He’s run it into the ground financially; he’s made it a place where performers don’t want to perform, and individuals don’t want to attend performances.”In an interview, she said her staff was seeking a legal opinion on whether the president could make a decision to shutter the venue without the involvement of Congress.Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio and an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center’s board, said Mr. Trump had “acted with total disregard for Congress,” which she said should have been consulted.“Countless employees, artists, and others likely have existing contracts and agreements with the Center,” she said. “What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is exactly why congressional oversight is so important.”In a post to X on Sunday, Mr. Grenell wrote that the center “desperately needs this renovation,” and that the closure would enable its staff to “better invest our resources, think bigger and make the historic renovations more comprehensive.”Mr. Trump, who has described his renovation projects in Washington during his second term as a “relaxing” part of his job, has already involved himself in the minutiae of the center’s building. He ordered federal workers to paint the building’s gold columns white, and he commented on its chillers and boilers.Renovation plans have been said to include redoing the seats in the opera house and replacing 30-year-old pieces of rigging equipment backstage, but a two-year shutdown suggests far more ambitious plans.There was no immediate word where the National Symphony Orchestra, which has vowed to keep playing at the center in the midst of the exodus, would perform over those two years. In a typical year, the orchestra plays as many as 150 performances at the Kennedy Center.The Washington National Opera has already begun to find other halls. “The W.N.O. is grateful to the performance venues who have committed to partnering with us in the coming seasons,” said Francesca Zambello, the artistic director of the opera. The organization has already scheduled one opera for Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University.Mr. Trump made his announcement on what has always been a busy night for American culture and music: the Grammy Awards are taking place in Los Angeles. And it came two days after he used the center as a venue for thepremiere of a documentary about his wife, “Melania.”Shawn McCreesh contributed reporting.",

      "title": "U.A.E. Firm Quietly Took Stake in the Trump Family’s Crypto Company",
      "content": "An investment firm tied to the United Arab Emirates purchased nearly half of the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company last year, making the family business partners with the U.A.E. even as President Trump negotiated foreign policy matters with the Middle Eastern nation.The investment, reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, was confirmed on Sunday by a spokesman for the Trumps’ crypto company, World Liberty Financial.Days before his father’s inauguration in January 2025, Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, signed the agreement with the investment firm for a $500 million investment in World Liberty, The Journal reported. David Wachsman, a World Liberty spokesman, confirmed the transaction in a statement to The New York Times.That agreement gave the Emirati-backed firm a 49 percent stake in World Liberty. Two top lieutenants to the U.A.E.’s national security adviser, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, joined the board of World Liberty.Asked about the terms of the deal, including the board seats, the timing and the size of the investment, Mr. Wachsman said, “We made the deal in question because we strongly believe that it was what was best for our company as we continue to grow.”Representatives for Sheikh Tahnoon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump family’s business dealings with the Emiratis have blurred the line between government and private enterprise, alarming ethics experts and congressional Democrats.Sheikh Tahnoon, a member of the Emirati royal family, has been a major foreign policy intermediary with the United States for over a decade on matters varying from combating terrorism to sharing advanced computer technology. He runs a sprawling investment empire that includes G42, a technology firm that has become a powerhouse in the booming world of artificial intelligence.The investment in World Liberty was one of two large transactions last year involving the Trumps’ crypto firm and the Emirati government. At a conference in Dubai in May, World Liberty executives disclosed that MGX, another company run by Sheikh Tahnoon, was using $2 billion worth of a digital currency issued by World Liberty, known as a stablecoin, to make a large investment.That maneuver alone turned World Liberty into one of the world’s largest issuers of stablecoins — a type of cryptocurrency that maintains a price of $1. The deal was poised to generate tens of millions of dollars a year in revenue for World Liberty.President Trump, through an entity called DT Marks DEFI LLC, effectively controls a large stake in World Liberty, which generated $57 million for him just as the company was starting up, according to his financial disclosure report last year. Revenues from the company are also shared with Zach Witkoff, the son of Steve Witkoff, who is Mr. Trump’s Middle East envoy, among other partners.Overall, the Trump family’s crypto investments in the past year have increased the family’s net worth by more than $1 billion, at least on paper.At the same time that the crypto deal came together, the Emirati government secured an agreement with the Trump administration for the export of hundreds of thousands of advanced chips to power A.I. technology.The White House agreed to the deal despite concerns from some national security officials in the Trump administration that the U.A.E. might share the chips with China, which could potentially use them to advance its military weapons systems.In an investigation last year, The New York Times reported that the chip negotiations intersected in critical ways with World Liberty’s business dealings, involving many of the same people and unfolding simultaneously. A G42 employee held a job at World Liberty at the same time that he worked for the Emiratis, The Times reported last year.The Times did not find evidence that the chip exports were explicitly offered in return for the crypto investment, or vice versa. But the findings prompted outrage from Democrats in Congress, who called for investigations by the inspectors general at the Commerce and State Departments.The State Department’s inspector general said in December that it was conducting a review of the matter, a standard step before any kind of formal investigation might be opened. The Commerce Department did not respond on Sunday when asked about the status of the review.In his statement, Mr. Wachsman of World Liberty said that “any claim that this deal had anything to do with the administration’s actions on chips is 100 percent false.”“The idea that, when raising capital, a privately held American company should be held to some unique standard that no other similar company would be held is both ridiculous and un-American,” he said.The White House has also denied any connection between World Liberty and the chips exports and disputed any suggestion that Mr. Trump had a conflict of interest.“The president has no involvement in business deals that would implicate his constitutional responsibilities,” David Warrington, the White House counsel, said in a statement to The Times on Sunday. “President Trump performs his constitutional duties in an ethically sound manner, and to suggest so otherwise is either ill-informed or malicious.”Mr. Warrington added that Mr. Witkoff, in his work as Middle East envoy, “has not and does not participate in any official matters that could impact his financial interests.” The White House confirmed last year to The Times that Mr. Witkoff had been “briefed on all major policy decisions in the region” but disputed assertions by other Trump officials that he participated in meetings where the Emirates chip deal was discussed.Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, called the new revelations evidence that the Trump family, Mr. Witkoff and their other business partners had “sold out American national security in order to benefit the president’s crypto company.”On Sunday, she said that the agreement to sell chips to the Emirates should be terminated and White House officials should be called to testify on the matter.“This is corruption, plain and simple,” Ms. Warren said in a statement. “Congress needs to grow a spine and put a stop to Trump’s crypto corruption.”",

      "title": "‘Melania’ Arrives With Strong Box Office Showing for a Documentary",
      "content": "Amazon’s gold-plated rollout for Melania Trump’s documentary resulted in opening-weekend ticket sales of $7 million in the United States and Canada, box office analysts said on Sunday. That gave “Melania” the best start for a documentary (excluding concert films) in 14 years.It was a face-saving result for the first lady — last week, ticket sales were pacing at about $5 million — but not for Amazon, which spent an exorbitant $75 million to buy distribution rights to “Melania” and market its release in 1,778 domestic theaters. Theater owners keep roughly 50 percent of ticket sales, meaning that Amazon will end the weekend with about $3.5 million to show for its investment.On Saturday, analysts projected roughly $8 million in domestic ticket sales for the nearly two-hour film. The actual amount, $7 million, suggests that opening day was front loaded with Mrs. Trump’s fans. (Analysts projected the $8 million by collecting Friday sales data from various theater circuits, measuring presales for Saturday and Sunday and extrapolating from there.)Even so, “Melania” had the best result for a wide-release documentary, excluding concert films, since 2012, when the nature film “Chimpanzee” arrived to $10.7 million, or about $15 million after adjusting for inflation, according to Comscore data. “Melania” placed third for the weekend at the North American box office. “Send Help,” a 20th Century Studios horror thriller, was No. 1, with about $20 million in ticket sales. “Iron Lung,” a low-budget horror-science fiction mash-up that was independently distributed, was second, selling an estimated $18 million in tickets.“Melania” was also released in 1,600 theaters overseas. Amazon declined to provide an estimate for international ticket sales on Sunday. Box office analysts said turnout was poor.In the United States and Canada, theaters in rural areas contributed roughly 46 percent of the opening-weekend total for “Melania,” far higher than is typical for a film opening, according to EntTelligence, a research firm. Republican counties also overperformed, contributing about 53 percent of ticket sales, according to EntTelligence. Top states included Florida, Texas and Arizona.The audience was overwhelmingly female (70 percent) and over the age of 55, according to Amazon.At the Cinemark Valley View and XD in Cleveland on Friday, the audience for a “Melania” screening included a couple of buses worth of people from a nearby senior center. “It was a nice fluff piece,” Gordon Wilson, 80, said as he exited. Another Cleveland attendee, Anita Dloniak, 68, chuckled when she heard that some of the other ticket buyers called the film propaganda. “What did they think it was going to be?” she said.Bob Schmidt, 60, went to see “Melania” at the Alamo Drafthouse on Staten Island on Friday. He rarely goes to the movies anymore, he said, but he bought a ticket to send a message to what he called the liberal movie industry. “I wanted to see this movie kick Hollywood’s ass,” Mr. Schmidt said. (During the screening, attendees erupted in applause during the scene when President Trump is sworn in. Someone shouted, “Trump 2028!”)Amazon, of course, can also monetize “Melania” on its Prime streaming service, where the film is expected to become available in three to four weeks. But the company’s spending on the documentary was so extreme — it paid $40 million for the rights alone, about $26 million more than the next closest bidder — that a question will linger: Was this all just an attempt for Amazon to ingratiate itself with President Trump?“This is a political investment, not a for-profit movie venture,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes an influential newsletter on box office numbers.Trump Administration: Live UpdatesUpdated Feb. 1, 2026, 7:17 p.m. ETTrump says the Kennedy Center will close for a 2-year reconstruction project.A U.A.E. firm quietly took a stake in the Trump family’s crypto company.Liam, the 5-year-old detained while wearing a bunny hat, is out of federal custody.Amazon’s lavish spending on “Melania” coincided with 16,000 layoffs at the company (on top of the 14,000 corporate employees it expunged in October), adding to a bumpy moment for the company’s brand.In recent weeks, Amazon had repeatedly said that it bought Mrs. Trump’s documentary “for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.” In a separate statement on Sunday, Amazon said it was “very encouraged” by domestic ticket sales, calling the theatrical release “an important first step in what we see as a long-tail life cycle for both the film and the forthcoming docuseries.” (The rights to “Melania” came with an accompanying series, also about Mrs. Trump, that is expected to appear on Prime Video this year.)People who went to see “Melania” gave it an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. “Elegant, informative and beautifully done” was Lynn Suter’s review, as she left a sold-out Friday showing of the film near Jupiter, Fla. Ms. Suter, a member of Conservative Gals of Palm Beach County, a Facebook group with more than 400 members, added that she intended to “tell everyone to go see it.”But critics savaged Mrs. Trump’s affectionate self-portrait. (She produced the film and had editorial control.) “It’s so orchestrated and airbrushed and stage-managed that it barely rises to the level of a shameless infomercial,” wrote Owen Gleiberman, chief movie critic for Variety, the Hollywood trade publication.“Melania” was directed by Brett Ratner (“Money Talks”), who has not directed a movie since 2017, when six women accused him of sexual misconduct. (He has denied those accusations.) Rolling Stone reported that two-thirds of the film’s New York crew asked that their names not be added to the film’s credits. Those who agreed to be credited included Jeff Cronenweth, an Oscar-nominated cinematographer (“The Social Network,” “Gone Girl”).Cameras rolled on Mrs. Trump for 20 days last January, culminating in President Trump’s second inauguration.Michael Adema, 32, who identified himself as a Democrat, said he bought a ticket to a 9:30 p.m. showing of “Melania” at the AMC Century City in Los Angeles because he was interested in Mrs. Trump’s life story.“Whether you see Melania Trump as the good girl or the bad girl, she’s somebody whom I believe is inspiring people to think in a particular way, and you can deny it or you can accept it,” Mr. Adema said.Outside of concert films, documentaries have always been a niche box office draw. Over the past 15 years, only three documentaries have collected more than $20 million in North America: “Chimpanzee,” a nature film; “2016: Obama’s America,” a partisan takedown of President Obama; and Morgan Neville’s “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?,” about the host of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”No documentary has ever cost as much as “Melania,” though. To grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s spending on “Melania” is, consider that Focus Features spent an estimated $12 million, or $15.5 million after adjusting for inflation, on “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?” release rights and marketing.Every so often, a documentary hits a mass cultural nerve. “Fahrenheit 9/11,” Michael Moore’s flame-throwing film about George W. Bush and the 2001 terrorist strike on the United States, holds the record for the best-selling documentary in history. It collected $119 million in North America in 2004, or $208 million in current dollars.Ida Lieszkovszky, Michaela Towfighi, Nicole Danna and Emmanuel Morgan contributed reporting.© 2026",
